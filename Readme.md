# Udacity Maze Project
This project is part of the Udacity VR Nanodegree program, and consists of a maze that you can navigate through in VR.  In order to successfully complete the maze, you need to first find a key that will allow you to unlock the door that hides the treasure at the end of the maze.  You navigate through the winding corridors by looking at waypoints and clicking on them to move, and you can also collect coins as you progress through the maze!

## Installation
* If you own an Android phone, you can install the app by simply copying the `MazeBuild.apk` file from the **Build** directory onto your android device, and installing the apk by clicking on it from the file manager.
* If you own an iPhone, you will need to follow the instructions below for **contributing** to this app, and then switch to the iOS platform in build settings before rebuilding and running on your phone.

## Contributing
You will need to download and install the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/), as well as the [Google VR SDK Plugin for Unity](https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/download) to be able to edit this app.  Next, you will need to clone this GitHub repo, and then open the `vrnd-course3-starter-project` in the Unity editor to begin making modifications to the maze project.

## Lessons Learned
**What I liked:** I really enjoyed using scripting to make the key unlock the door and for animating the door and the various objects you could collect throughout the maze.  It's amazing the level of control you have when using the scripts and how they can be combined with the different objects in the Unity editor to help create an interactive world.  I also enjoyed using Git to make commits throughout this project, which enabled me to be a little braver with my changes and coding, knowing that I could fall back on a previous commit if needed.

**What was challenging:** Building all of the walls was a little bit tedious at first, until I figured out that I could multi-select and copy whole wall segments that I had already built.  I also had to draw out a map on a piece of paper to help plan out the maze I wanted to build - when I first started the project, I felt a little lost and directionless, and this helped me to focus and build with a purpose!

**Comments:** This was a very fun project and I learned a lot while doing it!  I definitely plan to play around with the maze scene some more in the future to try out different things and maybe make a fun little mini-game for family and friends to play to showcase my skills :-)
