<b>What I liked:</b> I really enjoyed using scripting to make the key unlock the door and for animating the door and the various objects you could collect throughout the maze.  It's amazing the level of control you have when using the scripts and how they can be combined with the different objects in the Unity editor to help create an interactive world.  I also enjoyed using Git to make commits throughout this project, which enabled me to be a little braver with my changes and coding, knowing that I could fall back on a previous commit if needed.

<b>What was challenging:</b> Building all of the walls was a little bit tedious at first, until I figured out that I could multi-select and copy whole wall segments that I had already built.  I also had to draw out a map on a piece of paper to help plan out the maze I wanted to build - when I first started the project, I felt a little lost and directionless, and this helped me to focus and build with a purpose!

<b>Comments:</b> This was a very fun project and I learned a lot while doing it!  I definitely plan to play around with the maze scene some more in the future to try out different things and maybe make a fun little mini-game for family and friends to play to showcase my skills :-)
